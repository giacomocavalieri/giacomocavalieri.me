daily annoyances.
Lately I&#39;ve been annoyed by GitHub&#39;s UI and I set up to fix this using Gleam and
a little Raspberry Pi Zero.</p></section><section class="stack"><h2 id="The-problem">The problem</h2><p>I work a lot on the <a href="https://github.com/gleam-lang/gleam">Gleam compiler</a>, it&#39;s
quite common for me to have many open PRs waiting to be reviewed and merged.
One thing that usually happens is one of them (or some other PR) is merged and
then conflicts start popping up without me noticing, until the reviewer pings me
asking for a rebase.</p><p>The thing that&#39;s been bugging me for a while is that GitHub&#39;s PR view is not
showing me the mergeability of any of my open PRs: that is wether they have
conflicts I need to address, or if they don&#39;t need any of my attention.</p><p><img src="/imgs/github-prs-view.png"></p><p>Whenever a PR is merged I need to go check each of the remaining ones
individually and see if there&#39;s a conflict or not. I find that quite annoying!</p></section><section class="stack"><h2 id="The-solution">The solution</h2><p>GitHub has a handy <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/graphql">GraphQL API</a>.
I had used it a couple of times to write small scripts, and so I was pretty
confident it could help me solve this problem.
I don&#39;t need to fetch a lot of data: for each PR I need to know its title, a
url pointing to it, whether it is mergeable, and if it is a draft.
The GraphQL query I ended up writing looks like this:</p><pre><code class="not-prose language-graphql hljs" data-lang="graphql">query {
  viewer {
    pullRequests(first: 50, states: OPEN, orderBy: { field: UPDATED_AT, direction: DESC }) {
      nodes {
        title
        url
        mergeable
        isDraft
      }
    }
  }
}
</code></pre><p>So how do we query the GitHub GraphQL API using Gleam? We can craft an HTTP
request with the proper headers and body as suggested by GitHub&#39;s own
<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/guides/forming-calls-with-graphql#communicating-with-graphql">documentation</a>:</p><ul><li><section class="stack"><p>The endpoint is <code>https://api.github.com/graphql</code></p></section></li><li><section class="stack"><p>It needs to be a POST request…</p></section></li><li><section class="stack"><p>…with a json body containing a <code>&quot;query&quot;</code> string field</p></section></li><li><section class="stack"><p>and an <code>&quot;authorization&quot;</code> header with a suitable <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens">GitHub token</a></p></section></li></ul><p>Building such request in Gleam can look something like this, using the
<a href="https://hexdocs.pm/gleam_http/index.html">gleam_http</a> package:</p><pre><code class="not-prose language-gleam hljs" data-lang="gleam">import gleam/http
import gleam/http/request

pub fn fetch_pull_requests(gh_token: String) {
  let query = &quot;the GraphQL query I showed you earlier&quot;

  let request =
    request.new()
    // It&#39;s a POST request
    |&gt; request.set_method(http.Post)
    // For the `api.github.com/graphql` endpoint
    |&gt; request.set_host(&quot;api.github.com&quot;)
    |&gt; request.set_path(&quot;/graphql&quot;)
    // With an authorization header
    |&gt; request.prepend_header(&quot;authorization&quot;, &quot;bearer &quot; &lt;&gt; gh_token)
    // And a json body containing a `&quot;query&quot;` string field
    |&gt; request.set_body(&quot;{ \&quot;query\&quot;: \&quot;&quot; &lt;&gt; query &lt;&gt; &quot;\&quot;}&quot;)
}
</code></pre><p>And we&#39;re good to go, now we have to actually send the request and see what the
server replies with. We&#39;re using the
<a href="https://hexdocs.pm/gleam_httpc/index.html">gleam_httpc</a> client to do that:</p><pre><code class="not-prose language-diff hljs" data-lang="diff"> import gleam/http
 import gleam/http/request
+import gleam/httpc

 pub fn fetch_pull_requests(gh_token: String) {
   let query = &quot;the GraphQL query I showed you earlier&quot;

-  let request =
+  let assert Ok(response) =
     request.new()
     |&gt; request.set_method(http.Post)
     |&gt; request.set_host(&quot;api.github.com&quot;)
     |&gt; request.set_path(&quot;/graphql&quot;)
     |&gt; request.prepend_header(&quot;authorization&quot;, &quot;bearer &quot; &lt;&gt; gh_token)
     |&gt; request.set_body(&quot;{ \&quot;query\&quot;: \&quot;&quot; &lt;&gt; query &lt;&gt; &quot;\&quot;}&quot;)
+    |&gt; httpc.send
 }
</code></pre><blockquote class="stack"><p>Here I&#39;m <a href="https://tour.gleam.run/advanced-features/let-assert/"><code>assert</code></a>-ing
that I will get a response from the server, so this code will crash in case
there&#39;s an error.
For my little application it is completely fine to crash when an error occurs,
but most of the times you&#39;d want to actually deal with the error!</p></blockquote><p>The JSON string we get back looks something like this (after being nicely
formatted):</p><pre><code class="not-prose language-json hljs" data-lang="json">{
  &quot;query&quot;: {
    &quot;viewer&quot;: {
      &quot;pullRequests&quot;: {
        &quot;nodes&quot;: [
          { &quot;mergeable&quot;: &quot;CONFLICTING&quot;, &quot;isDraft&quot;: true, &quot;title&quot;: &quot;...&quot;, &quot;url&quot;: &quot;...&quot; },
          { &quot;mergeable&quot;: &quot;MERGEABLE&quot;, &quot;isDraft&quot;: false, &quot;title&quot;: &quot;...&quot;, &quot;url&quot;: &quot;...&quot; },
          { &quot;mergeable&quot;: &quot;UNKNOWN&quot;, &quot;isDraft&quot;: false, &quot;title&quot;: &quot;...&quot;, &quot;url&quot;: &quot;...&quot; }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
</code></pre><p>So the first PR has a conflict that needs to be addressed, while the second one
has no issues. The third PR has an <code>&quot;UNKNOWN&quot;</code> status, that means GitHub is
still determining if it can be safely merged or not.</p><p>It&#39;s pretty straightforward to describe such a PR using a couple of
<a href="https://tour.gleam.run/data-types/custom-types/">custom types</a> in Gleam:</p><pre><code class="not-prose language-gleam hljs" data-lang="gleam">pub type PullRequest {
  PullRequest(
    title: String,
    url: String,
    mergeability: Mergeability,
    is_draft: Bool
  )
}

pub type Mergeability {
  Conflicting
  Mergeable
  Unknown
}
</code></pre></section><section class="stack"><h3 id="Dealing-with-the-unknown">Dealing with the unknown</h3><p>The response we get back from the API is a plain string containing an unknown
JSON object. So, before we can do anything meaningful with this data, we need to
parse it into something with a known shape: a list of <code>PullRequest</code>s in this
case.</p><p>One can do that in Gleam using a
<a href="https://hexdocs.pm/gleam_stdlib/gleam/dynamic/decode.html"><code>Decoder</code></a>: a value
that can be used to turn unknown data into well typed values.
The nice thing about decoders is that they can compose nicely, so we can start
with small building blocks and join them together as needed.
Let&#39;s start with the decoder for mergeability, those are plain strings in
the JSON response:</p><pre><code class="not-prose language-gleam hljs" data-lang="gleam">import gleam/dynamic/decode.{type Decoder}

pub fn mergeability_decoder() -&gt; Decoder(Mergeability) {
  // We first start by trying to decode a string...
  use decoded_string &lt;- decode.then(decode.string)

  // ... if we could decode it, then we can check if it&#39;s one of
  // the three expected values:
  case decoded_string {
    // If it is, we succeed and return the corresponding value.
    &quot;CONFLICTING&quot; -&gt; decode.success(Conflicting)
    &quot;MERGEABLE&quot; -&gt; decode.success(Mergeable)
    &quot;UNKNOWN&quot; -&gt; decode.success(Unknown)

    // Otherwise we fail providing an example and a textual
    // description of what we were expecting to see.
    _ -&gt; decode.failure(Unknown, &quot;Mergeability&quot;)
  }
}
</code></pre><p>We can now define a decoder that takes care of decoding a single PR object, by
decoding each individual field:</p><pre><code class="not-prose language-gleam hljs" data-lang="gleam">pub fn pull_request_decoder() -&gt; Decoder(PullRequest) {
  use title &lt;- decode.field(&quot;title&quot;, decode.string)
  use url &lt;- decode.field(&quot;url&quot;, decode.string)
  // We decode the &quot;mergeable&quot; field by using the decoder we&#39;ve defined earlier!
  use mergeability &lt;- decode.field(&quot;mergeable&quot;, mergeability_decoder())
  use is_draft &lt;- decode.field(&quot;isDraft&quot;, decode.bool)

  // If we can decode all the fields we care about, then we can return a PR!
  decode.success(PullRequest(title:, url:, mergeability:, is_draft:))
}
</code></pre><p>And now everything is ready to decode the full response into a list of pull
requests:</p><pre><code class="not-prose language-gleam hljs" data-lang="gleam">import gleam/json

pub fn fetch_pull_requests(gh_token: String) -&gt; List(PullRequest) {
  // ...

  let response_decoder =
    decode.at(
      [&quot;data&quot;, &quot;viewer&quot;, &quot;pullRequests&quot;, &quot;nodes&quot;],
      decode.list(pull_request_decoder())
    )

  let assert Ok(pull_requests) = json.parse(response.body, response_decoder)
  pull_requests
}
</code></pre><p>Notice how we pieced together the little decoders we defined to get an
increasingly more powerful decoder: we start with something that can decode just
a mergeability string into a Gleam type, we use it to define something that can
decode a single pull request. Finally, we can use that to define a decoder that
decodes a list of pull requests that is found deeply nested in a json object.</p><p>Now we&#39;re just missing a way to nicely display all this data!</p></section><section class="stack"><h3 id="Enters-the-trusty-Raspberry-Pi-Zero">Enters the trusty Raspberry Pi Zero</h3><p>A while ago I got a

when my friends come over; and all the code powering it is written in, you
guessed it, Gleam.
For this I&#39;m using the <a href="https://gleam-wisp.github.io/wisp/">Wisp</a> framework.
The gist of it is you define a handler that, given an HTTP request, produces a
response:</p><pre><code class="not-prose language-gleam hljs" data-lang="gleam">// The simplest handler I could think of: always returns a fixed html response.
pub fn handle_request(req: wisp.Request) -&gt; wisp.Response {
  &quot;&lt;h1&gt;Hello, Joe!&lt;/h1&gt;&quot;
  |&gt; wisp.html_response(200)
}
</code></pre><p>The real deal is actually a bit more complex and will do routing using pattern
matching:</p><pre><code class="not-prose language-gleam hljs" data-lang="gleam">pub fn handle_request(req: wisp.Request) -&gt; wisp.Response {
  case wisp.path_segments(req) {
    [] -&gt; homepage()
    [&quot;games&quot;, &quot;scattergories&quot;] -&gt; scattergories_page(req)
    _ -&gt; wisp.not_found()
  }
}
</code></pre><p>So having this already set up, I decided to make it a bit more capable and add a
new route to serve a page showing all that useful info gathered from GitHub&#39;s
API:</p><pre><code class="not-prose language-diff hljs" data-lang="diff"> pub fn handle_request(
   req: wisp.Request,
+  gh_token: String,
 ) -&gt; wisp.Response {
   case wisp.path_segments(req) {
     [] -&gt; homepage()
     [&quot;games&quot;, &quot;scattergories&quot;] -&gt; scattergories_page(req)
+    [&quot;git&quot;, &quot;pull-requests&quot;] -&gt; pull_requests_page(gh_token)
     _ -&gt; wisp.not_found()
   }
 }
</code></pre><p>All the hard work of fetching and decoding the pull requests is already
implemented in <code>fetch_pull_requests</code>, so we just need a way to dinamically
produce some HTML document from those.</p></section><section class="stack"><h3 id="HTML-templating-with-Lustre">HTML templating with Lustre</h3><p>To do that I&#39;m using <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/lustre/index.html">Lustre</a>, a Gleam web
framework for building HTML templates, single page applications, and real-time
server components.
In my case I&#39;m using it just for the HTML templating, and it looks like this:</p><pre><code class="not-prose language-gleam hljs" data-lang="gleam">import lustre/element/html

pub fn pull_requests_page(gh_token: String) -&gt; Element(msg) {
  let pull_requests = fetch_pull_requests(gh_token)

  html.main([], [
    html.h1([], [html.text(&quot;Pull Requests&quot;)]),
    html.ul([], todo as &quot;the list items&quot;)
    //          ^^^^ A handy Gleam keyword to leave some bits
    //               and pieces of code unimplemented!
  ])
}
</code></pre><p>The thing I love about Lustre is that everything is just functions™️, there&#39;s
no external templating language, fancy macros, or new syntax I need to learn:
<em>all I know about refactoring and organising code applies just as nicely to my
HTML-producing code.</em>
So here to keep things nice and tidy I want to define a helper function that
takes care of turning a single pull request into a list item:</p><pre><code class="not-prose language-gleam hljs" data-lang="gleam">pub fn pull_request_to_li(pull_request: PullRequest) -&gt; Element(msg) {
  let mergeability = case pull_request.mergeability {
    Mergeable -&gt; &quot;✅&quot;
    Conflicting -&gt; &quot;❌&quot;
    Unknown -&gt; &quot;⚙️&quot;
  }

  let draft = case pull_request.is_draft {
    True -&gt; &quot; (DRAFT) &quot;
    False -&gt; &quot; &quot;
  }

  html.li([], [
    html.text(mergeability &lt;&gt; draft),
    html.a([attribute.href(pull_request.url)], [
      html.text(pull_request.title),
    ]),
  ])
}
</code></pre><p>That can be reused for all the pull requests in the list we&#39;ve fetched:</p><pre><code class="not-prose language-diff hljs" data-lang="diff"> import lustre/element/html
+import gleam/list

 pub fn pull_requests_page() {
   // In the real code this is read at startup from an env variable,
   // never put secrets in your code!
   let gh_token = todo as &quot;a GitHub access token&quot;
   let pull_requests = fetch_pull_requests(gh_token)

   html.main([], [
     html.h1([], [html.text(&quot;Pull Requests&quot;)]),
-    html.ul([], todo as &quot;the list items&quot;)
+    html.ul([], list.map(pull_requests, pull_request_to_li))
   ])
 }
</code></pre></section><section class="stack"><h2 id="The-final-result">The final result</h2><p>I set up a <code>systemctl</code> timer – thank you Louis for introducing me to that! –
to fire up the server listening on port 80 every time the Raspberry is turned

  wisp.configure_logger()

  // Totally fine to assert here, if those env variables are not set there&#39;s no
  // way we can try and keep running, so we might as well panic!
  let assert Ok(port) = envoy.get(&quot;DANEEL_PORT&quot;) |&gt; result.try(int.parse)
    as &quot;DANEEL_PORT should be set&quot;

    |&gt; mist.start

  process.sleep_forever()
}
