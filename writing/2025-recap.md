Time for a 2025 wrapped!

## Hello, GitHub Sponsors

This year I set up GitHub Sponsors. I'm really happy that I did, and thanks to
the kindness many people have showed me I had been able to dedicate my full time
to Gleam without having to look for another job.

So far it's worked out great, and I'm hoping to keep it going for 2026 as well.
My contributions, like making the Gleam [compiled JS code 30% faster](https://gleam.run/news/gleam-javascript-gets-30-percent-faster/)
have been possible thanks to individual sponsors like you!
If you would like to help me keep working on this, please
[consider becoming a sponsor.](https://github.com/sponsors/giacomocavalieri)

## A year in conferences

I submitted my talks to a whole lot of conferences and managed to go to quite a
few ones as a speaker:

- In June I gave a talk at [Lambda Days](https://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2025):
  [You Do Not Need an ORM](https://youtu.be/XEJxk5VUSTs?si=dhQxiURSFbT39Gik).
  It's about [Squirrel](https://github.com/giacomocavalieri/squirrel), a library
  to do type safe SQL in Gleam; people seemed to really enjoy it and I had so
  much fun delivering it!
- A few months later I flew to Boston to talk at [Squiggle Conf](https://squiggleconf.com).
  I was blown away by how well organised this conference was, the organisers did
  an amazing job! You should absolutely attend this one if you have the chance
  to.
- In October I [spoke about Gleam](https://youtu.be/LMrKEaAi4RI?si=zHCEcjWnh6TtDB_-)
  at the very first edition of [Func Prog Conf](https://funcprogconf.com) in
  Stockholm. I felt really honored to be one of the speakers and I really
  wish to be back next year too. Another one to keep an eye out for!
- Finally, in November I went to [Code BEAM Europe](https://codebeameurope.com),
  the conference dedicated to Gleam, Erlang, and Elixir. I absolutely love Code
  BEAM and this year was special as there were so many Gleam talks that we got a
  full Gleam track!

## Hello, 2026

This year I haven't written all that much, my resolution for 2026 is to try and
write more blog posts: I have a couple of articles that have been brewing in the
back of my head for a while and I'm hoping 2026 is the year I manage to put
those into words.

2025 has been full of [conferences](https://giacomocavalieri.me/speaking.html)
and I'm hoping I can talk at many new ones the coming year! 2026 is already
shaping to be an exciting year with the first ever all-Gleam conference: the
[Gleam Gathering](https://gleamgathering.com).

One final big resolution: this year I started learning Polish (dziękuję Kamila
for all the help!!) I'm quite a slow learner when it comes to languages, but for
2026 I'm hoping to get to a B1 level.

That's it, thanks for reading and I wish you all a Happy New Year!
