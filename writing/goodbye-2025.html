I&#39;m really happy that I did, and thanks to
the kindness many people have showed me I had been able to dedicate my full time
to Gleam without having to look for another job.</p><p>So far it&#39;s worked out great, and I&#39;m hoping to keep it going for 2026 as well.
My contributions, like making the Gleam <a href="https://gleam.run/news/gleam-javascript-gets-30-percent-faster/">compiled JS code 30% faster</a>
have been possible thanks to individual sponsors like you!
If you would like to help me keep working on this, please
<a href="https://github.com/sponsors/giacomocavalieri">consider becoming a sponsor.</a></p></section><section class="stack"><h2 id="A-year-in-conferences">A year in conferences</h2><p>I submitted my talks to a whole lot of conferences and managed to go to quite a
few ones as a speaker:</p><ul><li><section class="stack"><p>In June I gave a talk at <a href="https://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2025">Lambda Days</a>:
<a href="https://youtu.be/XEJxk5VUSTs?si=dhQxiURSFbT39Gik">You Do Not Need an ORM</a>.
It&#39;s about <a href="https://github.com/giacomocavalieri/squirrel">Squirrel</a>, a library
to do type safe SQL in Gleam; people seemed to really enjoy it and I had so
much fun delivering it!</p></section></li><li><section class="stack"><p>A few months later I flew to Boston to talk at <a href="https://squiggleconf.com">Squiggle Conf</a>.
I was blown away by how well organised this conference was, the organisers did
an amazing job! You should absolutely attend this one if you have the chance
to.</p></section></li><li><section class="stack"><p>In October I <a href="https://youtu.be/LMrKEaAi4RI?si=zHCEcjWnh6TtDB_-">spoke about Gleam</a>
at the very first edition of <a href="https://funcprogconf.com">Func Prog Conf</a> in
Stockholm. I felt really honored to be one of the speakers and I really
wish to be back next year too. Another one to keep an eye out for!</p></section></li><li><section class="stack"><p>Finally, in November I went to <a href="https://codebeameurope.com">Code BEAM Europe</a>,
the conference dedicated to Gleam, Erlang, and Elixir. I absolutely love Code
BEAM and this year was special as there were so many Gleam talks that we got a
full Gleam track!</p></section></li></ul></section><section class="stack"><h2 id="Hello-2026">Hello, 2026</h2><p>This year I haven&#39;t written all that much, my resolution for 2026 is to try and
write more blog posts: I have a couple of articles that have been brewing in the
back of my head for a while and I&#39;m hoping 2026 is the year I manage to put
those into words.</p><p>2025 has been full of <a href="https://giacomocavalieri.me/speaking.html">conferences</a>
and I&#39;m hoping I can talk at many new ones the coming year! 2026 is already
shaping to be an exciting year with the first ever all-Gleam conference: the
<a href="https://gleamgathering.com">Gleam Gathering</a>.</p><p>One final big resolution: this year I started learning Polish (dziękuję Kamila
for all the help!!) I&#39;m quite a slow learner when it comes to languages, but for
2026 I&#39;m hoping to get to a B1 level.</p><hr><p>That&#39;s it, thanks for reading and I wish you all a Happy New Year!</p></section></main></body></html>
