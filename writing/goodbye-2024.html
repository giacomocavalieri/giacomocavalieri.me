I wanted to try something
new and as I&#39;ve never done this kind of year-in-review thing I thought it could
be fun to take some time and write about what I did in 2024.</p></section><section class="stack"><h2 id="Another-year-with-Gleam">Another year with Gleam</h2><p>Let&#39;s get the important stuff out of the way first,
<a href="https://gleam.run/news/gleam-version-1/">Gleam went v1 this year!</a>
This was a huge milestone and the community growth that followed it has been
incredible to witness.</p><p>The language itself has grown loads since going v1, getting fault tolerant
compilation, amazing improvements to the language server, some new
<a href="https://giacomocavalieri.me/posts/a-new-gleam-feature-i-love">pieces of handy syntax</a>,
and so much more. I&#39;m really excited for
<a href="https://gleam.run/roadmap/">what&#39;s in store for the upcoming years</a> and so
incredibly proud to be part of this project.</p><p>During the summer I&#39;ve also started working on a fun Gleam project called
<a href="https://github.com/giacomocavalieri/squirrel">squirrel</a>, it allows one to work
with SQL in Gleam while retaining type safety and a great developer experience.
My plan for 2025 is to write a couple of blog posts about this sharing what I&#39;ve
learned and its inner workings, I think it&#39;s really cool.</p><p>In December I went to Rome to meet two Gleamlins that were visiting from Canada
and the UK; it&#39;s always great being able to put a face and voice to the people
you chat with daily on the internet.</p></section><section class="stack"><h2 id="A-year-in-conferences">A year in conferences</h2><p>I would have never expected it but this year I managed to attend (and talk at!)
so many conferences, it&#39;s a literal dream come true:</p><ul><li><section class="stack"><p>In February I attended <a href="https://fosdem.org/2025/">Fosdem</a> with a dear friend
of mine. He made the trip all the more special!
Also I&#39;ll never forget this Fosdem because in the BEAM room,
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clsTrQUt-4M">Louis announced that Gleam would soon become v1</a>.
I was so excited, I could barely stand still in my seat!</p></section></li><li><section class="stack"><p>In May I went to Krakow with my brother to attend
<a href="https://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2025">Lambda Days</a>.
It&#39;s my second year attending and it&#39;s always so much fun; to make it even
better, this year Hayleigh was talking about Lustre (I&#39;m afraid the video is
not up yet as I&#39;m writing this).
And I did the crazy thing of doing a
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1pZN1kSiLA&amp;list=PLvL2NEhYV4ZtX2TurK0BIlKD_cHct0rSs&amp;index=17">lightning talk about snapshot testing</a>.
It all happened so quickly I was terrified, at one point my watch went off and
warned me my heart rate was concerningly high!</p></section></li><li><section class="stack"><p>Ok, so I know it&#39;s technically not a conference, but in August I was in London
for a Gleam meetup.
Meeting my online friends in person <em>easily</em> beats any conference anyway!</p></section></li><li><section class="stack"><p>Back to conferences, in October I was in Copenhagen to give a
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHe_wzFg4W8&amp;">talk about Gleam at GOTO</a>.
The conference had such a nice vibe! I got the chance to meet Kris Jenkins and
Evan Czaplicki; proving me that &quot;you should never meet your heroes&quot; is a
really bad saying.</p></section></li><li><section class="stack"><p>October was a really busy month, a couple of days after GOTO I went to
<a href="https://codebeameurope.com">Code BEAM Europe</a>.
I had a blast: everyone attending was so nice, I feel so lucky to be part of
the BEAM community!
This time I gave a proper talk about snapshot testing, sadly it&#39;s still not up
yet.</p></section></li><li><section class="stack"><p>Last but not least, this December I gave a talk at
<a href="https://yowcon.com">YOW! Australia</a>.
All the speakers were truly amazing, not just from a technical standpoint.
They are just great people to hang with and I&#39;ll forever cherish the time we
spent together being silly and shouting &quot;MANGOES!&quot;.</p></section></li></ul></section><section class="stack"><h2 id="Hello-2025">Hello, 2025</h2><p>My big goal for the upcoming year is to open a GitHub sponsorship page, I&#39;ve
been putting this off for months now because reasons™️ and 2025 is the year I
bite the bullet and finally do it.</p><p>Another way less ambitious goal I have is to try and read more books, both
technical and novels! My to-read list is growing way faster than I can keep up,
so I&#39;d love to dedicate more time to that.</p><hr><p>That&#39;s it! 2024 was far from perfect, it was really crappy at times.
But I&#39;d rather focus on the fun times I had than dwell on the negative stuff!
Fingers crossed that 2025 will be even better, I wish everyone a happy new
year 🤞</p></section></main></body></html>
