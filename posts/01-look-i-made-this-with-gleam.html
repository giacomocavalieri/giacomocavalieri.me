I&#39;m Giacomo üëã</p><p>I love functional programming and getting caught in rabbit holes; the thing I
love most, though, is sharing what I learn with my friends (sorry guys for
nagging you, you&#39;re the best for putting up with me)!</p><p>What better way to pester even more people than setting up a personal blog?
What gave me the push I needed to get started was an awesome programming
language I run into almost a year ago: <a href="https://gleam.run">Gleam</a>.</p><p>When I start learning a new language, I usually try to pick up a small-ish
project to help keep me motivated; the idea of writing a personal blog was
already in the back of my mind, so when I approached Gleam I decided to write...
you guessed it: a static site generator!</p><p>Long story short, I never actually completed my side project; but during this
journey I fell in love with Gleam and its community and I decided to stick
around and set up this blog to share my thoughts.</p><blockquote><p>If you&#39;re wondering, this blog is still written using Gleam; I ended up
using a brilliant package called <a href="https://lustre.build">lustre</a>.
Do check it out!</p></blockquote><h2>Simple and productive</h2><p>The first thing that amazed me is how easy it is to pick up Gleam and be
productive with it, even from day one.
That&#39;s because Gleam is a remarkably simple language: a couple of evenings could
be enough for you to learn all there is to its core and start hacking on your
own projects.</p><blockquote><p><em>&quot;But what if I&#39;ve never tried functional programming before?</em>
<em>Will I find it easy anyways?&quot;</em></p><p>Getting into functional programming can be a bit daunting.
I remember when I first got started with it ‚Äî almost four years ago ‚Äî I
gave up twice before it finally clicked.
That&#39;s totally normal! FP has its own way of doing things and it can require
quite the mindset shift and a lot of head scratching to get used to it.</p><p>If you&#39;ve never tried functional programming or ‚Äî just like me ‚Äî you&#39;ve tried
and were discouraged, I can recommend you the
<a href="https://exercism.org/tracks/gleam/concepts">Gleam&#39;s Exercism track</a>: it will
guide you through the language and gently help you get in the &quot;functional&quot;
mindset!</p></blockquote><p>But what does simple actually mean? To me it&#39;s the ability to <em>concisely put my</em>
<em>ideas into code without having to trudge through loads of bells and whistles,</em>
having to painstakingly decide which is the right fit for the problem at
hand.</p><p>The language offers you a <em>small number of features</em> that are
<em>useful and cohesive,</em> there&#39;s no two ways to do the same thing.
Coming from languages with a huge surface ‚Äî like Scala, Kotlin or C#, just to
name a few ‚Äî it feels almost exhilarating: the language only allows you to
follow a single, well-defined path instead of dropping you in the middle of a
maze of choices.</p><h3>Ok, but what does Gleam look like?</h3><p>Enough talk, let&#39;s have a look at a Gleam program:</p><pre><code data-lang="gleam" class="not-prose language-gleam">// this is not going to be the code example, I just need it
// to get a sense of how the code will look!

import gleam/io

pub opaque type Foo {
  Bar(bar: Int, baz: String)
}

/// main!!!
///
pub fn main() {
  let bar = Bar(1, &quot;hello&quot;)
  use a &lt;- result.try(Ok(1))
  case bar {
    Bar(1, &quot;h&quot; &lt;&gt; _) -&gt; Error(&quot;foo&quot;)
    Bar(_, _) -&gt; Ok(11_000)
  }
  Nil |&gt; io.debug
}</code></pre><h2>An outstanding developer experience</h2><p>When you start using Gleam, it&#39;s impossible not to notice the great
amount of love and work that went into making sure the language has a lovely
developer experience.</p><p>Let me show you how straightforward it is to get started and the many niceties
you get out of the box.</p><p>TODO list:</p><ul><li><p>getting started with a project is as easy as <code>gleam new</code></p><ul><li><p>you get all the scaffolding needed to start hacking</p></li><li><p>and some niceties like a github action to run tests in CI (it just shows
the great amount of care that went into it)</p></li></ul></li><li><p>zero configuration formatter out of the box</p><ul><li><p>no bikeshedding (that&#39;s huge!)</p><ul><li><p>personal experience with scala</p></li><li><p>hours lost with my friends</p></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p>friendly and helpful compiler</p><ul><li><p>great error messages</p><ul><li><p>some examples!</p></li></ul></li><li><p>your greatest ally</p></li></ul></li></ul><h2>Get in for the language, stay for the amazing community</h2><p>What really sealed the deal for me was the incredible community that has formed
around the language.</p><p>People in the official Discord are welcoming and incredibly nice.
Even after the worst disheartening days at work, chatting with everyone always
managed to lighten my mood.
I&#39;ve learnt loads of new things just by hanging around and it&#39;s just a pleasure
to chat and share things with everyone.</p></main></article></div></body></html>
