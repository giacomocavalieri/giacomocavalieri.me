I&#39;m Giacomo üëã</p><p>I love functional programming and getting caught in rabbit holes; the thing I
love most, though, is sharing what I learn with my friends (sorry guys for
nagging you, you&#39;re the best for putting up with me)!</p><p>What better way to pester even more people than setting up a personal blog?
What gave me the push I needed to get started was an awesome programming
language I run into almost a year ago: <a href="https://gleam.run">Gleam</a>.</p><p>When I start learning a new language, I usually try to pick up a small-ish
project to help keep me motivated; the idea of writing a personal blog was
already in the back of my mind, so when I approached Gleam I decided to write...
you guessed it: a static site generator!</p><p>Long story short, I never actually completed my side project; but during this
journey I fell in love with Gleam and its community and I decided to stick
around and set up this blog to share my thoughts.</p><blockquote><p>If you&#39;re wondering, this blog is still written using Gleam; I ended up
using a brilliant package called <a href="https://lustre.build">lustre</a>.
Do check it out!</p></blockquote><h2>Simple and productive</h2><p>The first thing that amazed me is how easy it is to pick up Gleam and be
productive with it, even from day one.
That&#39;s because Gleam is a remarkably simple language: a couple of evenings could
be enough for you to learn all there is to its core and start hacking on your
own projects.</p><blockquote><p><em>&quot;But what if I&#39;ve never tried functional programming before?</em>
<em>Will I find it easy anyways?&quot;</em></p><p>Getting into functional programming can be a bit daunting.
I remember when I first got started with it ‚Äî almost four years ago ‚Äî I
gave up twice before it finally clicked.
That&#39;s totally normal! FP has its own way of doing things and it can require
quite the mindset shift and a lot of head scratching to get used to it.</p><p>If you&#39;ve never tried functional programming or ‚Äî just like me ‚Äî you&#39;ve tried
and were discouraged, I can recommend the
<a href="https://exercism.org/tracks/gleam/concepts">Gleam&#39;s Exercism track</a>: it will
guide you through the language and gently help you get in the &quot;functional&quot;
mindset!</p></blockquote><p>But what does simple actually mean? To me it&#39;s the ability to <em>concisely put my</em>
<em>ideas into code without having to trudge through loads of bells and whistles,</em>
having to painstakingly decide which is the right fit for the problem at
hand.</p><p>The language offers you a <em>small number of features</em> that are
<em>useful and cohesive,</em> there&#39;s no two ways to do the same thing.
Coming from languages with a huge surface ‚Äî like Scala, Kotlin or C#, just to
name a few ‚Äî it feels almost exhilarating: the language only allows you to
follow a single, well-defined path instead of dropping you in the middle of a
maze of choices.</p><h3>Ok, but what does Gleam look like?</h3><p>Enough talk, let&#39;s have a look at a Gleam program:</p><pre><code data-lang="gleam" class="not-prose language-gleam">import gleam/io

/// A pet can either be a cat or a dog,
/// in either case they have a name
///
pub type Pet {
  Cat(name: String)
  Dog(name: String)
}

pub fn speak(pet: Pet) -&gt; String {
  case pet {
    Cat(..) -&gt; &quot;meow&quot;
    Dog(..) -&gt; &quot;woof&quot;
  }
}

pub fn describe(pet: Pet) -&gt; String {
  pet.name &lt;&gt; &quot; goes &quot; &lt;&gt; speak(pet) &lt;&gt; &quot;!&quot;
}

pub fn main() {
  Dog(name: &quot;James&quot;)
  |&gt; describe
  |&gt; io.println
  // -&gt; &quot;James goes woof!&quot;
}</code></pre><h2>An outstanding developer experience</h2><p>When you start using Gleam, it&#39;s impossible not to notice the great
amount of love and work that went into making sure the language has a lovely
developer experience.</p><p>Let me show you how straightforward it is to get started and the many niceties
you get out of the box.</p><h3>Dead simple setup</h3><p>Getting started with a new project is incredibly straightforward: just type
<code>gleam new</code> and the name of your project and you&#39;re ready to start hacking!</p><pre><code data-lang="text" class="not-prose language-text">&gt; gleam new my_project

Your Gleam project my_project has been successfully created.
The project can be compiled and tested by running these commands:

    cd my_project
    gleam test</code></pre><p>The CLI tool takes care of all the scaffolding you need; and you also get some
additional niceties out of the box: a <code>.gitignore</code> tailored for Gleam projects
and a GitHub workflow to run your tests when you push to a repo. For me this
was the cherry on top since I hate writing those!</p><p>It&#39;s these little details that really show the attention that went into making
sure the developer experience is as smooth as possible.</p><h3>No bikeshedding allowed here</h3><p>The language also ships with a zero configuration code formatter.
I can&#39;t stress enough how much I love this zero configuration approach: first,
it ensures a consistent look across all Gleam projects; it&#39;s a great quality of
life improvement, especially if you&#39;re trying to approach a codebase written by
someone else.</p><p>This also gets rid of the problem of endless bikeshedding around the look a
program should have. I once spent a good couple of hours reading through the
documentation and countless options of the Scala formatter, not considering the
time it took me and my team to agree on a single style.</p><p>I&#39;ve been so scarred by this experience that I&#39;ll always gladly take the zero
configuration approach over any configurable code formatter, even if the style
is not 100% to my liking.</p><h3>The compiler is your friend</h3><p>Another thing I love about Gleam is how nice its error messages are. The
compiler goes out of its way to display concise and helpful messages. Take for
example this little code snippet:</p><pre><code data-lang="gleam" class="not-prose language-gleam">pub type User {
  User(id: Int, name: String)
}

pub fn main() {
  let user = User(id: 1, name: &quot;Rob&quot;)
  io.println(user.nam) // &lt;- uh oh, we&#39;ve made a typo! 
}</code></pre><p>Let&#39;s have a look at the resulting error message:</p><pre><code data-lang="text" class="not-prose language-text">error: Unknown record field

  ‚îå‚îÄ ./src/app.gleam:6:19
  ‚îÇ
4 ‚îÇ io.println(user.nam)
  ‚îÇ                ^^^^ Did you mean `name`?

The value being accessed has this type:
    User

It has these fields:
    .id
    .name</code></pre><p>The compiler highlights the piece of code were something&#39;s wrong and tries to be
extra helpful; in this case it is smart enough to guess we&#39;ve made a typo and
meant to access the <code>name</code> property... how nice is that? I personally love the
friendly and helpful attitude of the compiler, it really feels like you have a
buddy constantly helping you and looking out for potential bugs in your code.</p><h2>Get in for the language, stay for the amazing community</h2><p>What really sealed the deal for me was the incredible community that has formed
around the language.</p><p>People in the official Discord are welcoming and incredibly nice.
Even after the worst disheartening days at work, chatting with everyone always
managed to lighten my mood.
I&#39;ve learnt loads of new things just by hanging around and it&#39;s just a pleasure
to chat and share things with everyone.</p></main></article></div></body></html>
