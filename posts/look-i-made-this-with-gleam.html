I&#39;m Giacomo üëã
I love functional programming and getting caught in rabbit holes; the thing I
love most, though, is sharing what I learn with my friends ‚Äì sorry guys for
nagging you, you&#39;re the best for putting up with me!</p><p>What better way to pester even more people than setting up a personal blog?
What gave me the push I needed to get started was an awesome programming
language I ran into almost a year ago: <a href="https://gleam.run">Gleam</a>.</p><p>When I start learning a new language, I usually try to pick up a small-ish
project to help keep me motivated; the idea of writing a personal blog was
already in the back of my mind, so when I approached Gleam I decided to write‚Ä¶
you guessed it: a static site generator!
Long story short, I never actually completed my side project but I fell in love
with Gleam and its community and I decided to set up this blog to share my
thoughts.
I even ended up being part of the core team! I want to keep this short so that&#39;s
going to be a story for another blog post.</p><blockquote><p>If you&#39;re wondering, this blog is still written using Gleam; in the end
I used a brilliant package called
<a href="https://github.com/lustre-labs/lustre">lustre</a>, it&#39;s leagues better than
anything I could have come up with on my own! Do check it out.</p></blockquote><p>What really sealed the deal and made me stick around was the lovely and
welcoming community that has formed around the language.
People in the <a href="https://discord.gg/daRe3WpYPK">official Discord</a> are incredibly
nice: chatting with everyone always managed to lighten my mood even after the
worst, most disheartening days at work.
I&#39;ve learnt loads of new things just by hanging around and it&#39;s just a pleasure
to chat and share things with other gleamlins ‚Äì yes, that&#39;s what I call other
Gleam programmers.</p><hr><p>That&#39;s all for now! A big thank you for reading my ramblings, I hope you&#39;ll be
around for the next blog post!</p></main></article></div></body></html>
