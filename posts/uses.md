## Hardware

- _Mac Mini M2 Pro (2023)_
- _Apple Magic Keyboard, Trackpad and Mouse_
- _reMarkable 1,_ I love the big e-ink display to read books and annotate pdfs

### Writing stuff

- _Pilot Custom 823 - Demo Brown,_ my main driver, I love the nib and the clear
  body. Never had a single problem with it in many many years! Right now I'm
  using her with a classic _Pilot Blue_ ink, I really like the way it shades
- _Pelikan M200 - Pastel green,_ loaded with the beautiful
  _Pilot Iroshizuku shin-ryoku_ green ink
- _Pilot Metropolitan,_ my first fountain pen, it holds a special place in my
  heart and it's still great to jot things down

## Software

- [_Zed_](https://zed.dev)
- [_Jujutsu,_](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/) I'm slowly getting the hang
  of how it works and the DX has been really nice so far
- [_Rectangle_](https://rectangleapp.com)
- [_Delta,_](https://github.com/dandavison/delta) I use this to show pretty
  git diffs on the command line, a real life saver
- [_Screen Studio,_](https://www.screen.studio) this makes the prettiest screen
  recordings I've ever seen
