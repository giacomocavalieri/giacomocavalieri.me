## Hardware

- _Mac Mini M2 Pro (2023)_
- _Apple Magic Keyboard, Trackpad and Mouse_
- _reMarkable 1,_ I love the big e-ink display to read books and annotate pdfs

### Writing stuff

- _Pilot Metropolitan,_ my first fountain pen, it holds a special place in my
  heart and it's still great to jot things down
- _Pilot Custom 823 - Demo Brown,_ My main driver, I love the nib and the clear
  body. Never had a single problem with it in many many years!
- _Noodler's bulletproof black ink,_ a great cheap black ink I used all the time
  to take notes at university.
